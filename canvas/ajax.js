// Create a new 'Tweeter' rails app. Scaffold 'Tweet' with a single field: 'message'
// Start your Rails server and add a few tweets.
// Create a new HTML document, add jQuery.
// Use jQuery to send a request to your Rails server, GET all the tweets. You'll need to resolve the CORS issue, Google :).
// Display all of these tweets on your page. Add some styling or use a framework to make it look more Twitter-esque
// Replace your jQuery AJAX with Fetch.

// Beast Mode
// Add a form to the top of the page which allows the user to create a new tweet. Once created (use AJAX), 
// the tweet should appear at the top of your list of tweets.
// Add a 'delete' button to each tweet. This should send a DELETE request to your server. Fade out the tweet 
// if it is deleted successfully.
// Update your model to include a 'starred' boolean. Users should be able to star/favorite tweets. Add some
//  kind of star icon on the front end.

// Beast Mode++
// Work on authentication/multiple users
