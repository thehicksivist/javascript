// Start with the following code:

// const sydney_campus = { state: 'NSW', street: '7 Kelly St' };
// const brisbane_campus = { state: 'QLD', street: '205 N Quay' };
// const melbourne_campus = { state: 'VIC', street: '120 Spencer St' };
// const coder_academy = { sydney: sydney_campus, melbourne: melbourne_campus, brisbane: brisbane_campus };

// Use console.log and interpolation to display your campus' street and state from the coder_academy object
// If we use code to delete the state from your campus, will your log of the coder_academy object still work? I.e. did it copy each campus object or does it reference each campus object?
// Research: value vs reference (a common interview question)
