// Let's build a todo list. Only use plain old vanilla JavaScript, don't use any JS frameworks. 
// Don't worry about styling for now. Here's what we're building (LINK IN CANVAS).
// We'll build an ugly version first before we worry about styling.
// Add an input box and a button to your app.
// When the user clicks the button, make a new todo item appear on the page.
// Set the input box back to an empty value when a task is added.
// Show the total number of tasks somewhere.
// We should be using forms with our input! Wrap your input box and button in a form. Make sure the button is a submit button. You'll need to update your event listener from `on button click` to `on form submit`. Pro tip: preventDefault will be helpful here.
// We can remove the button. Pressing enter will submit the form.
// Use Bootstrap to make it look similar to the demo.

// Beast Mode
// Allow tasks to be marked as complete.
// Add a progress bar to show % of tasks completed.
// Allow tasks to be removed.

// Beast Mode++
// Update the input functionality. It should also search the tasks as a user types. Demo
// Refreshing the page wipes all our data! Find a way to persist data.
