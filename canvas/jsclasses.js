// Challenge
// Create a Dog class. Each dog should have a name and a location.
// Add a speak method that logs "Woof! my name is {name}"
// Add a walk method that accepts two arguments: location (string) and distance (integer)
// Add a display_walks method that console.logs all of the dog's walks
// Add a total_distance method that returns the total distance of all the walks
// Research: what's the difference between console.log and return? Make sure you have a solid understanding
// Beast Mode
// Create a Walk class with properties: location and distance
// Update your Dog class: when the walk method is called, use this new Walk class to create a walk
// Introduce a timestamp to each walk, automatically add the current time when you instantiate a walk
// Beast Mode++
// Create a basic GUI in the browser to interact with your classes. Use buttons, prompts and lists to create and display dogs (view example).
// Add walks to the GUI. I.e. add a `New Walk` button to each dog and display their walks under their name.
